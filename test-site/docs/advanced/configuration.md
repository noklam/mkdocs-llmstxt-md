# Advanced Configuration

Advanced configuration options and use cases for the LLMsTxt plugin.

## Complex Section Definitions

You can create sophisticated section structures:

```yaml
plugins:
  - llms-txt:
      sections:
        "Getting Started":
          - index.md: "Welcome and introduction"
          - quickstart.md: "5-minute setup guide"
          - installation.md: "Detailed installation"
        "User Guides":
          - guides/*.md
          - tutorials/basic-*.md
        "API Reference":
          - api/overview.md: "API overview and concepts"  
          - api/endpoints/*.md
          - api/examples.md: "Usage examples"
        "Development":
          - dev/contributing.md: "How to contribute"
          - dev/architecture.md: "System architecture"
```

## Custom Copy Button

Customize the copy button appearance:

```yaml
plugins:
  - llms-txt:
      copy_button_text: "ðŸ“‹ Copy Source"
      # Button will appear with custom text
```

## Conditional Features

Disable features based on environment:

```yaml
plugins:
  - llms-txt:
      enable_copy_button: !ENV [ENABLE_COPY_BUTTON, true]
      enable_llms_full: !ENV [GENERATE_FULL_FILE, false]
```

## Integration with Other Plugins

Works well with other MkDocs plugins:

```yaml
plugins:
  - search
  - mkdocstrings  # API documentation
  - llms-txt:     # Should come after content-generating plugins
      sections:
        "API Docs":
          - reference/*.md  # Generated by mkdocstrings
```

## Performance Considerations

For large sites:

- Use specific file patterns instead of `**/*.md`
- Consider disabling `llms-full.txt` for very large documentation
- Copy button has minimal performance impact

## Security Notes

- Markdown files are served as static content
- No server-side processing of user input
- Copy button uses standard browser APIs
